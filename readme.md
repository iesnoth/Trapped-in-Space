# Unnamed Weird Space Game

### A Brief Overview
Have you ever wondered:
"What would it be like to be the pilot of a lo-fi 16-bit spaceship, but I still don't know what any of the buttons do?"
Well, this game seeks to satisfy that very specific curiosity.
There are a lot of buttons, you push a lot of buttons, and sometimes they do things.

Sometimes they do very bad things.

It's a low-stress puzzle box, with an open-ended nature which will have the tenacious gamer coming back over and over again, and give the competionist gamer a case of moon madness.

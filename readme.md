### A Brief Overview
Have you ever wondered:
"What would it be like to be the pilot of a lo-fi 16-bit spaceship, but I still don't know what any of the buttons do?"
Well, this game seeks to satisfy that very specific curiosity.
There are a lot of buttons, you push a lot of buttons, and sometimes they do things.

Sometimes they do very bad things.

It's a low-stress puzzle box, with an open-ended nature which will have the tenacious gamer coming back over and over again, and give the competionist gamer a case of moon madness.

## Gameplay

The player comes into the game blind, seeing just the console. Right away they can glean a few things about their situation:

    1. They are drifting through space,

    2. The ship they are in is low tech,

    3. There is no ticking clock: no depleting oxygen or food supply
    
However, there is no obvious goal. The little story the game has is found by pushing a _lot_ of buttons.

There's no set way to "win" the game, but the player can lose, and lose spectacularly. 

## The Features

- **So Many Buttons:**
    The big draw of the game is to play with a lot of buttons. None of them are labelled, and it's not obvious what any of them should do. "Low key frustration" is the mood I'm going for.
        - However, there are a couple puzzles where the buttons light up, suggesting they might have a sequence.
        - Half of them will just make a funny noise.
        - Each button has at least an *on* and *off* position.
    
    The coding goal is to have a few functions which work for every button, then some specialized events.

- **Animations:**
    There will be some animations for figuring out complicated puzzles, or losing. I'd also like to add ambient animation (example: flickering lights) if I have time and space (haha).

- **Note-taking:** A feature I'd like to add but not sure if I'll have time. Like I said, none of the buttons are labelled. But I'd like to give the players a way to take notes in-game. This is a stretch goal of sorts.

- **Languages**
    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. Javascript

- **Programs**
    1. VSCode
    2. Photoshop CC

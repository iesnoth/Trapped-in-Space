# Unnamed Weird Space Game

### A Brief Overview
Have you ever wondered:
"What would it be like to be the pilot of a lo-fi 16-bit spaceship, but I still don't know what any of the buttons do?"
Well, this game seeks to satisfy that very specific curiosity.
There are a lot of buttons, you push a lot of buttons, and sometimes they do things.

Sometimes they do very bad things.

It's a low-stress puzzle box, with an open-ended nature which will have the tenacious gamer coming back over and over again, and give the competionist gamer a case of moon madness.

## Gameplay

The player comes into the game blind, seeing just the console. They can glean a few things about their situation:
    1. They are drifting through space,
    2. The ship they are in is low tech,
    3. There is no ticking clock: no depleting oxygen or food supply
However, there is no obvious goal. The little story the game has is found by push a _lot_ of buttons.

## The Features

- So Many Buttons
    The big draw of the game is to play with a lot of buttons. None of them are labelled, and it's not obvious what any of them should do. "Low key frustration" is the mood I'm going for.
        - However, there are a couple puzzles where the buttons light up, suggesting they might have a sequence.
    Each button has at least an *on* and *off* position.
    
    The goal is to have a few functions which work for every button, then some specialized events.

- Animations
    These aren't high on my list of priorities, but if I have time I'd like to add some ambient animations, and some special ones as rewards for figuring out puzzles.
